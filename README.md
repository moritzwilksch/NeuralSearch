> Fixing the search function of my broker's knowledge base

# The Problem
Soooo... my broker has a "Knowledge Base" â€“ a collection of articles detailing their platform, fees, and processes. Many of these articles are highly informative and well written. **The problem: you can't find them** because the search function works... poorly. I took this as an inspiration to scrape all 773 articles and build a small search engine that is able to surface relevant articles for a query.

## Status Quo
The problem with the provided search functionality is that it only matches words in the query against titles. To make matters worse, the words have to match *exactly*, so you better not make any typos. I like to imagine that their search looks something like this:

```python
def search(query: str, articles: list) -> list:
  return [a for a in articles if query in a.title]
```

Now, to be fair, their platform is actually quite good and the main landing page of the brokerage has a great search function. But this example made me realize that there are loads of websites out there with poorly designed search functionality.

# The Solution
## TFIDF-based sub-word similarity
A simple solution based on similarity matching of the TFIDF representation of subwords in the articles yields quite an improvement over the status quo:

## Encoder Model
Use `SentenceTransformer` (multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1) to embed each sentence into latetent space. Score each sentence's similarity to the query embedding. The similarity score for a document is calculated as the mean over all sentence embeddings in the document.
